## PACS (Probabilistic model for Accessible Chromatin data in Single Cell)

PACS is a toolkit for snATAC-seq data analysis. The key functionalities
of PACS include:

1)  Depth correction for snATAC-seq data.
2)  Statistical test for complex data design
3)  Supervised cell type annotation (with a reference dataset)
4)  Batch effect correction enabled by statistical test framework

## Installation

You can install the development version of PACS from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Zhen-Miao/PACS")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to run PACS common workflow:

``` r
# library(PACS)
## basic example code
```
